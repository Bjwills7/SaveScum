# SaveScum
A simple tool used to save your game in Exanima. Made with Electron JS.
Exanima deletes your main save when you die and loads from the checkpoint when you press continue in the main menu.
This tool overwrites your checkpoint with your main save everytime the game saves. For the most part the game only saves when you exit to the menu so all you have to do to manually save is exit to the menu.
Once you run the app choose the save file you want to track (Exanima001.rsg) then press start, the dialog box will tell you if autosave is enabled. If you want to start tracking a different save press the stop button, choose the new save, then press start again.
Now when you die you will start where you last exited the game instead of the portal.

***You should backup your save folder before using this tool.*** The folder is located at: C:\Users\"Your user name"\AppData\Roaming\Exanima
Do not try to track your arena save with this tool, it is only meant for the main game.
